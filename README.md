game. This package is optimized to run on a raspberry pi with some
optional extra hardware.

## Setup

- Raspberry pi 3 Model B+
- Display (eg television) with HDMI input*
- USB number pad (recommended) *or* USB keyboard with number pad

* if the display does not have audio capabilities, you can also use a
  1/4" stereo audio input, such as computer speakers.

## Music

Using a keyboard number pad, the GM (game master) can control music
and ambient sounds quickly within the game.

## Maps (coming soon)

player's movements.
